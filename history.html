	<h1>History</h1>
	<p><strong>Training Zone</strong> have been the leader in all kinds of training that covers Management and IT in Plongk St, Cairnsville for the last 150 years.
	<br>
	<br>
	The founder of the company, <span>Terrence Zonas</span> is still CEO and spokesperson for Training Zone. Here is one of his first ever training lessons, the world-famous Lecture Clash training:
	Anyone got a lecture clash? They're not pretty, but with your help, they can be manageable. Here are some thoughts on how to deal with it: 
		<ul>
			<li>Realize that it's up to you. You are responsible for making it work.</li>
			<li>Attend one lecture and get the notes from the other (start with the web notes, but that's not enough).</li> 
			<li>Find a friend in the one you miss and get them to tell you what else was covered in class that's not on the web.</li>
			<li>Which one do you miss? - Some ideas to help you with that decision are:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If you miss one out of two lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of 3 that's 33%.</li>
					<li>Which one are you most on top of?</li>
					<li>Which subject has the most complete lecture notes?</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Don't ask your lecturer - "Did I miss anything in the lecture?"</li> 
				<ul>
					<li>If you didn't miss anything, there'd be no point to lectures.</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
